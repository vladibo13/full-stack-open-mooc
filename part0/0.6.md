    participant browser

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    activate server
    Note right of browser: The POST request to the address new_note_spa contains the new note as JSON data containing both the content of the note (content) and the timestamp (date)
    server-->>browser: 201 status code, 
     Note right of browser: This time the server does not ask for a redirect, the browser stays on the same page, and it sends no further HTTP requests.
    deactivate server



    Note right of browser: The SPA version of the app does not traditionally send the form data, but instead uses the JavaScript code it fetched from the server. We'll look into this code a bit, even though understanding all the details of it is not important just yet.
